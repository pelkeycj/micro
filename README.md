### HW04 - Add Posts, Follows

Submission requirements:
- Github: https://github.com/pelkeycj/micro
- App:	  http://microblog.pelkey.tech/


### Expected Behavior
- Login: In order to login, an existing user enters their handle in the input box in the nav bar.
            They are then logged in and are brought to their user page.
- Posting: Users can make posts from anywhere in the app. They must click on "post" in the nav bar and they
            are brought to a page where they fill out a form to create a new post. After submitting
            the post, they are brought to the posts "show" page.
- Following: Users can follow any other user by visiting their user page and clicking follow (or unfollow
            if already following). The user will then see posts in chronological order (most recent first)
            on their home feed from all of the users that they follow. They can access the home feed by clicking
            on the brand icon in the upper right of the nav bar.
            Users can alternatively visit the "explore" page through the nav bar where they are able to
            explore users that they don't follow and posts from those people. The explore page
            displays items in random order. Users can see their followers/following by viewing their profile page 
            and then clicking on the number of followers/following that they have.
            
  
Note: The explore page currently shows all users in system and all posts in system.
        The filtering needs to be fixed to allow only strangers to show up.
